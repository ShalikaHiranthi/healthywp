# WordPress Plugin Observatory

WordPress platform has become a standard choice when it comes to Content Management Systems, published under Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) license. Moreover, a huge community built around it is responsible for more than 50.000 plugins, available also as FLOSS. Unfortunately not all WordPress plugins are “playing well” with each other, nor are properly maintained.

Our proposal aims in creating a platform which will crowd source experience on using or combining plug-ins in WordPress installations. In addition, with the application of state of the art software metrics, we will provide a preliminary study on the structure of the source code of the plug-ins. “WordPress Plugin Observatory” (WOPLOB) will be published as FLOSS  with the hope that, with the help of Mozilla Network, will evolve to a high quality community of WordPress users that will help to the development of the platform and the data collection.
