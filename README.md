# WordPress Plug-in Observatory

Welcome to WordPress Plug-in Observatory project. We aim in creating a infrastructure that will combine state of the art software metrics with crowd sourced user experience to an online knowledge base that will help the WordPress enthusiasts and / or professionals built effective, secure and "healthy" websites.

The project was selected for the [5th round of Mozilla Open Leaders](https://mozilla.github.io/leadership-training/round-5/projects/#wordpress-plugin-observatory) program which will run from February to June 2018. 

## Summary

WordPress platform has become a standard choice when it comes to Content Management Systems (CMS), published under Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) license. Moreover, a huge community built around it is responsible for more than 50.000 plug-ins, available also as FLOSS. Unfortunately not all WordPress plug-ins are “playing well” with each other, nor are properly maintained.

We are creating a platform which will crowd source experience on using or combining plug-ins in WordPress installations. In addition, with the application of state of the art software metrics, we will provide a preliminary study on the structure of the source code of the plug-ins. “WordPress Plug-in Observatory” will be published as FLOSS  with the hope that, with the help of Mozilla Network, will evolve to a high quality community of WordPress users that will help to the development of the platform and the data collection.
