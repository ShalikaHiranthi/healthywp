# WordPress Plug-In Observatory (WOPLOB)

Welcome to WordPress Plug-in Observatory project. We are thrilled you stopped by. 

If you are familiar with [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org), the Content Management System that powers 30% of the web, consider lending us a hand ;)

## Elevator Pitch

We are building a platform which primarily aims in crowd sourcing good and bad experiences on using or combining plug-ins in WordPress installations. The analysis of those experiences will be available to the users via a user friendly, search engine, allowing them to build effective and secure WordPress websites.


## Why?

WordPress platform has become a standard choice when it comes to Content Management Systems (CMS). Is is a Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) project which means is can be freely downloaded, used, altered and even sold (under the term of its <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/license/" target="_blank">license</a>). 

Moreover, a huge community built around it is responsible for more than 50.000 plug-ins, available also as FLOSS. Unfortunately not all WordPress plug-ins are “playing well” with each other, nor are properly maintained.

We are creating a platform which will crowd source experience on using or combining plug-ins in WordPress installations. In addition, with the application of state of the art software metrics, we will provide a preliminary study on the structure of the source code of the plug-ins. “WordPress Plug-in Observatory” will be published as FLOSS  with the hope that, with the help of Mozilla Network, will evolve to a high quality community of WordPress users that will help to the development of the platform and the data collection.
